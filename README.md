# *Prog* Language Development

*This project is in its fairly early stages of development and is non-functional as of 7/31/24. As it is fundamentally a learning project, I make no promises to the viability of this as working software at any point in its lifecycle.* 

## Background/Idea

I am fascinated by the idea of developing an interpreter for a custom programming language. I am not an experienced developer; however, I am also not sure which domain of programming I really want to get into as a professional, so I am at a bit of a wall in my learning journey. One thing I have noticed up to this point though, is that I seem to be really fascinated by syntax and semantics of language design, among other aspects of developer tooling. At this point, I finally feel like I have the foundation in programming that I need to work on this project. I'm still not at the level to make a polished product, but what better way to get there than to try it?

*I don't claim that I will be able to make an excellent language*; just that I have my own set of preferences that I will aim to implement to the best of my ability. It's a learning project. If it happens to grow beyond that, cool! If I'm the only person to ever read this, also cool! 

## About

*Prog* is a somewhat opinionated, interpreted programming language from someone without a strong background in computer science. While I am in the process of learning, I still consider myself a fairly new programmer, especially relative to current professionals in the field. I don't have a background in anything related to computer science, but I do have a degree in education (Music-Ed, to be specific), and I know my own learning style quite well. This project is going to serve as one of my primary motivators as I branch into more intermediate - advanced topics of programming.

## Name

For now, I'm going to call this project *Prog*. Very original, I know. For what it's worth, you don't technically know that it's related to anything about programming. Could be short for 'progress' for all you know. Admittedly, I'm not good at naming things, so this was just one decision I had to get out of the way quickly, though I'm actually relatively satisfied with an ambiguous double entendre. 

## Design

The very first idea for this project came to me upon learning that part of the inspiration for Ruby was to build a more object oriented language than Python. Because of this, my initial thought was to design a functional spin on Ruby. That said, you can already use Ruby in a pretty functional style if you really wanted to. 

Instead, I chose to simply attempt to combine my favorite features of other languages, then draw inspiration from what I see being built. In technical terms, I call this the "try it, see what happens, wash-rinse-repeat" method. I am a big fan of this method. 

The current design details can be found in `planning.md`.
The current syntax reference can be found in `syntax.txt`.
