Prog Syntax

Basic: 

  Comments:
    # : Single-line comment 

  Arithmetic:
    +  : Add
    -  : Subtract
    *  : Multiply
    /  : Divide
    %  : Remainder divide

  Strings:

    ' '     : char
    " "     : string
      Unlike current interpreted languages, these will not be interchangeable. 
      Flexibility will come from overloading string operations with char operations, if necessary (and possible).

    print "The quick brown fox"  : for single line strings
    puts "The quick brown fox"   : includes a newline

    "The quick brown fox".length : for the length of the string in bytes

  Literals:
    0 - 9 : integer
    3.14  : double
    ' '   : char
    " "   : string    
    true  : bool
    null  : null

  Variables:
    let example = "immutable variable"
    let mut another = "mutable variable"

  Control Flow:
    Conditionals:
      You can couple the conditions and branches together:
        if condition {
          # do something 
        } elif condition {
          # do something else
        } else {
          # do a third thing
        }

      You can also put the subsequent branches on newlines:
        if condition {
          # do something
        }
        elif condition {
          # do something else
        }
        else {
          # do a third thing
        }

      Or put the opening brace on its own line:
        if condition
        {
          # do something
        }
        elif condition
        {
          # do something else
        }
        else
        {
          # do a third thing
        }

    Loops:
      You can loop over a range:
        for i in 0..10 {
          # do something with i.
        }
      
      You can specify a step as well:
        for i in 0..10 by 2 {

        }
        for j in 10..0 by -1 {
          
        }
      
      You can also loop over a collection:
        let items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        for item in items {
          # do something with the items.
        }
      
      You could use a condition instead, if you wanted to:
        let mut i = 0
        for i < 10 {
          # don't forget to increment manually!
          i += 1
        }
